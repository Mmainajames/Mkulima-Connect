# **Vibe Coding 4-3-2 Hackathon**

## Project Description
This project is written, and deployed using Google's Firebase Studio.
The project is in line with the 2nd SDG- Zero Hunger
The application aims to bridge the gap between farmers and buyers, particularly those who buy produce in bulk with focus on reducing post harvest losses.

## How it Works
- Farmers create an account and place listing of their produce with desired pricing/unit

- On the other hand, buyers make a search, make an offer to the farmers. Both parties negotiate and once they agree on the price the buyer pays then the farmer initiates shipment which is closely monitored until it gets to the buyer. If there is any dispute, they inform the company which in turn takes over the matter till conclusion.  

- Farmers get valuable Realtime AI-generated Insights about pricing of various crops in different regions. Such data allows them to make informed decision about regions they can fetch good prices for their produce.

## The Prompt 
You are designing the **Mkulima Connect platform**, a modern agricultural marketplace connecting farmers directly with buyers to reduce post-harvest losses, enable fair negotiations, and ensure secure payments with shipment tracking.  

The platform must reflect an **agriculture-first aesthetic**: clean, minimal, professional, with **green (growth), earthy tones (soil, sustainability), and white accents (trust & transparency)**. Use modern typography and consistent spacing. The provided logo (green crop in a container frame) should be visible in the header and login screens.
